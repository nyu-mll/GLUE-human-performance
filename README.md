# FAQ & Instructions

Thanks for doing our HITs! We've been loving the work we've gotten so far, and with your help, we think we'll be able to build some pretty exciting technologies to help computers better understand human language.

Is there a right answer?
It's complicated. When we collected these sentence pairs, we collected labels with them, and we hope that when those labels are correct, you'll usually agree with them. But we don't expect you to always agree. Some of the labels are simply wrong, and we want to use your input to correct them. But also, the task depends on what kinds of background assumptions seem reasonable to you, and we want you to use your own common sense.

Should one label be more common than the others?
Ideally, no. We already have labels for all of these pairs, and we have an equal number of pairs with each of the three types of label, so if you find yourself assigning one of the three labels most of the time, try to reconsider how you are evaluating the captions. However, your responses don't need to 

Will you reject all of my work?
No. Unless it's clear to us that you are assigning labels across many HITs without even considering the captions, we won't reject any of your work.

Will you really pay out the bonuses?
Yes. You have to trust us to some extent, but we'll put the correct answers up in a hidden Google doc before we launch the HIT, and if you're wondering what those answers were after the batch of HITs is complete, we can show you the doc, and you can use the edit history to verify that the answers were sane and were there before you started.

Where do these captions come from?
Each pair of captions was written by two different people as part of two different MTurk tasks.

When do you approve HITs?
We are grad students buried in work, so we can't promise to look at the data directly any more often than once a day.

When should I fill out the 'problems' field?
You should fill this out if you can't complete the HIT, and not otherwise. This should be either if the caption is total nonsense (you can't even guess what it's describing), or if HIT interface is partially broken (no caption, for example). If there is a typo in a caption, but you think you know what it means anyway, please don't report it. Never put anything in this field if there isn't a problem.

Who are you?
We are busy graduate students with the Bowman Group, a subgroup of the ML2 group at New York University Center for Data Science. We are also affiliated with the NYU Departments of Computer Science and Linguistics.
