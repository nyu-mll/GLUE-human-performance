The New York University Center for Data Science is collecting your answers for use in research on computer understanding of English. Thank you for your help!

We will present you with a prompt taken from a letter someone wrote. Your job is to figure out, based on this correct prompt (the first prompt, on top), if another prompt (the second prompt, on bottom) is also correct:


Choose definitely correct if any event or situation that can be described by the first prompt on top would also fit the prompt on the bottom. Example: 

<p><span style="color:green"> "The legislation was widely hailed as a model for the country." </span></p>

<p><span style="color:blue"> "Many people thought the legislation was a model for the country." </span></p>


Choose maybe correct if the prompt on the bottom could describe an event or situation that fit the first prompt, but could also describe sentences that don't fit the first prompt. Example: 

"The program has helped victims in 90 court cases, and 150 legal counseling sessions have been held there."

"Victims from 90 grand jury court cases were helped by the program."


Choose definitely incorrect if any event or situation that could possibly be described with the first prompt on top would not fit the prompt on the bottom. Example: 

"As a result, Chris Schneider, executive director of Central California Legal Services, is building a lawsuit against Alpaugh Irrigation."

"Central California Legal Services' executive director decided not to pursue a lawsuit against Alpaugh Irrigation."


You do not have to worry about whether the writing style of the line is maintained in the prompt.
